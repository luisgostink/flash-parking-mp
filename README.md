# Project Name: FlashParking
FlashParking is a web-app where people can reserve parking spots based on the user's location, retrieving parking space availability information. This, with the purpose of finding the nearest available parking space. The original idea was thought for people with reduced mobility.  
This project is my final project for the **web development** Bootcamp I attended at [Opportunity ZÃ¼rich]((https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/sd/de/index/unterstuetzung/ai/arbeitsintegrationsozialhilfe/opportunity.html)). 

# Brief Description
I want to develop a web-app that will show the users a list with the parking spaces available based on the user's location, retrieving parking space availability information. With that in mind the user can reserve the nearest parking spot available. The main objective of the priject was to create a minimalistic user friendly app where you can find the nearest available parking spot based on the user location.

# My motivations for this project. 
Despite the fact that I am a professionally trained musician, I've been always interested in technology. As I teenager I developed interest in computers to the point that I used to work as a freelance computer technician using remote support apps and also upgrading computer components and doing system maintenance for private clients. Therefore, when I was offered this apprenticeship, I thought it would be a good opportunity to certify my knowledge in the area of programming and to be able to access the job market in the field of IT. There, I learned some programming technologies such as HTML, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), JavaScript, and frameworks like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or Vue.js. The technologies used for the project were: [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (framework), HTML, [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and Javascript.
