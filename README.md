# FlashParking
As part of the **web development** semester course I attended at **Opportunity Zurich**, this project will be my **masterpiece** with a deadline of **29.12.2023.**


# Brief Description
I want to develop a web-app that will show the users a list with the parking spaces available based on the user's location, retrieving parking space availability information. With that in mind the user can reserve the nearest parking spot available.


# Project Objective
The main objective of the priject is to create a minimalistic user friendly app where you can find the nearest available parking spot based on the user location: 

## Mandatory
### Frontend Features: 
- Welcome page with the brief description of the app and a button to go to the login page. The user must first login or create an account before reserving a parking spot. 
- Login page (form) with a link that redirects to the create account page.
- Create account page (form). 
- Parking list *or map(?)* with all the available parking spots, with a hover or redirect function to see where its located and how far away is from the user's location. 

### Backend Features: 
- User login form. 
- Create user form. 
- Database: 
    - Users table. 
    - Parking spots table. 

## Nice to have (both Frontend and Backend)
- Light/dark mode toggle. 
- Language translation to Spanish and German. 
- Be able to reserve a parking spot for a limited amount of time and if the user wants, can rebook it. 
- Built in payment system. 


# Techstack
The website will be build using the following technologies: 
- **Frontend:** HTML, SCSS, Javascript.
- **Backend:** MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Laravel.  
- **Deployment:** Forge. 
- **Provider:** Digital Ocean.


### Rough Roadmap
## Mandatory
### Phase 1 - Planning (01.11.2023 - 02.11.2023)
- Figma and Co.
- Elaborate concept.
- Create a LoHi wireframe.
- Determine design.

### Phase 2 - Basic functions (06.11.2023 - 10.11.2023)
- Creating the HiFi wireframe.
- Create Database Schema. 
- Building the basic structure of the website.
- Home page (homepage).
- About me/imoressum page. 
- Login page.
- Register page.
- Create database Models, Controllers, and Seeders.

## Optional
### Phase 3 - Aditional functions (13.11.2023 - 24.11.2023)
- Let one user reserve multiple parking spots but reserved only to that user, so another user cannot reserve a parkingspot that was already reserved.
- Show a list of the parking spots that the user has reserved.
- Light/dark mode toggle. 
- Language translation to Spanish and German. 
- Be able to reserve a parking spot for a limited amount of time and if the user wants, can rebook it. 



### Phase 4 - Improvements, Testing and Bug-fixing.
