                <p>Hello!  My name is Luis Gostin. 
                    I always define myself first as a musician 
                    because it's my first love, 
                    but I have also been interested in technology, 
                    due to my experience working as a freelance computer technician.  
                    This app is my masterpiece project for my 6 months apprenticeship I did at Opportunity Zurich</p>
